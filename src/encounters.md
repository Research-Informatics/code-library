## Encounter Types

For cohort derivation and data extraction, it is important to consider the encounter types you are using in your queries. Often, the research question requires our team to specify encounters of interest, even in the case of "all utilization".

The Research Data Warehouse has accounted for several nuances regarding encounters and are essential for you to be aware of as you query.

### **dbo.EncounterAncillary_V**
This view is designed to bifurcate encounters to isolate services that support care but donâ€™t initiate or coordinate treatment. This decision enables us to readily query encounters of primary interest to Research while still having ready access to ancillary encounters. Ancillary encounters are still critical, but they typically reflect follow-up, monitoring, or supportive care rather than primary medical management. Depending on the research question, you may need to include this view in your work.

### **dbo.Encounter_V**
This is the primary view for encounters and should be used in most cases. 

Below are the fields in encounter_v.
