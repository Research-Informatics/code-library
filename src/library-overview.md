A shared code library is an essential tool for the Research Data & Informatics team. It serves as a centralized repository for reusable code, scripts, and reference materials that streamline workflows and improve efficiency. In a research environment where data is complex and timelines are tight, the library provides a foundation for collaboration, consistency, and scalability.

## Key Benefits

### 1. Standardization and Reproducibility
- Standardized functions and scripts reduce errors and ensure consistent approaches across projects.  
- Shared code promotes reproducibility, enabling others to validate, extend, or reuse work.  

### 2. Efficiency and Productivity
- Pre-built functions save time that would otherwise be spent reinventing solutions.  
- The library supports rapid prototyping and deployment, letting the team focus on innovation.  

### 3. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing
- A centralized repository makes resources accessible to all team members.  
- Documented code preserves institutional knowledge beyond individual contributors.  

### 4. Scalability and Adaptability
- A common foundation supports growth, enabling the team to adapt quickly to new needs and challenges.
