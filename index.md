Welcome to the **Research Data Analyst Resource Guide**. This resource is built to support analysts working with clinical research data—providing technical references, practical examples, and shared standards. It’s here to make day-to-day work more efficient, while offering consistent approaches the whole team can rely on.

## Scope & Use

This guide focuses on resources for analysts working with research data in our environment. It covers technical references, reusable code, and standards for common tasks such as data extraction, cleaning, and curating.  

It is not intended as an external-facing data dictionary or a substitute for formal training. Instead, it provides practical tools and shared practices that support consistent, high-quality analysis across the team.

## Governance & Maintenance

This guide is maintained by the Research Data & Informatics team. Content is reviewed for accuracy, efficiency, and alignment with institutional standards before inclusion.  

Team members are encouraged to suggest updates or contribute new resources. Changes are incorporated through a review process to ensure the guide remains reliable, consistent, and useful for everyday work.
